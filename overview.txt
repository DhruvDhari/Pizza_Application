Model: Manages data and business logic.
View: Handles layout and display.
Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.

Sync->> code that runs one by one,
jabh pehli line chalegi tabhi new line pe jaega
like if a website is loading then website wont work until and unless it loads fully which is a wrong practice .

                   |- 3)REJECTED -- failed
